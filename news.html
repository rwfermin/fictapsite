											<h4>Want free public WiFi? Slash processing time of permits - DICT</h4>

												<span>Gelo Gonzales, Rappler</span>

											</p>

											<p>

											The biggest hindrance to the rollout of free public WiFi is the time it takes to get permits from local government units (LGU), an official from the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT) told a technical working group (TWG) meeting at the Senate on Tuesday, October 4.

											</p>

											

											<p>

												In order to install or operate the necessary equipment or infrastructure in an area, the DICT and its partners have to secure a number of permits and licenses, Enrico Toledo, the project manager for the DICT's free WiFi projects, explained.

											</p>

											FRAYED CONNECTION. The issue with LGU permits remains unresolved, hindering the speed at which the DICT and its partners can roll out its free WiFi project. Photo by <a href = "http://www.rappler.com/" target = "_blank">RAPPLER.</a>

											</p>

											

											<p>

											The problem, Toledo said, is not the requirements â€“ as they are â€œvery simpleâ€ â€“ but the amount of time it takes for the local government units to process the permits after the requirements have been submitted. It can take â€œa month or 2 or 3â€ before the LGUs successfully process the permits.

											</p>

											

											<p>

												Taking a month or more for LGUs to process the permits is just too long, the project manager said. The waiting time has to be reduced from months to days if the department is able to hit its target of deploying WiFi to 5,250 schools by November 2017, he said.</p>

												

											<p>â€œThree days,â€ Toledo recommended.</p>

											

											<p>The 5,250 schools include 347 state universities and colleges (SUC), 2,855 public high schools, and 2,048 elementary schools across the country. Before the year ends, they are targeting implementation in 668 municipalities, each with one to 2 schools.

											<h4>ICTO Signs Cooperation Pact with FICTAP on TV White Space</h4>

											<p class = "news-date">

												<i class = "fa fa-calendar-o"></i>

												<span>03.31.2014</span>

											</p>

											<p>A wide-ranging memorandum of understanding of mutual cooperation to bring to the country's rural areas the benefits of TV white space technology by using unused TV channels as internet carriers was recently signed between the Information and Communications Technology Office <b>(DOST-ICTO)</b> and the Federation of International Cable TV and Telecommunications Associations of the Philippines <b>(FICTAP).</b></p>

												<b>Seated, from left:</b> FICTAP's Alvin Ty, Dr. Cecilia La Madrid-Dy, National Chair Estrellita "Neng" Juliano-Tamano, ICTO's Executive Director Louis Napoleon C. Casambre and Deputy Executive Director Bettina Quimson and FICTAP's Agaton B. Bejerano Sr. Standing from left: FICTAP Board Members Ruben M. Cortez, Atty. Roberto M. Jocom Jr., Rolando R. Olog, Fernando M. Penson, Joselito P. Galicia, Jose G. Delmendo, Luis C. Go Jr. and Ricbenson M. Marasigan.

											</p>

											<p>The Information and Communications Technology Office (DOST-ICTO) has signed a working arrangement with the Federation of International Cable TV and Telecommunications Associations of the Philippines (FICTAP) to help flesh out its objective of bringing the benefits of television white space technology (TVWS) to the Philippine countryside.</p>

											<p>ICTO, a development-oriented entity attached to the Department of Science and Technology, is the agency mandated by law to craft and implement programs and policies to ensure the speedy and efficient delivery of public services that will improve the county's global competitiveness in the constantly advancing information and communications technology.</p>

											<p>A project which the ICTO is now fast-tracking is a framework on TVWS which will enable the delivery of internet service to the rural areas, specifically in public schools, hospitals and government offices. TV white space technology is so-called because it will utilize unused television channels as carriers of internet to places that are too far for any existing internet providers to reach.</p>

											<p>FICTAP, whose large network of micro, small and medium cable TV enterprises constitutes the widest coverage of Philippine rural areas, is in an ideal position to help ICTO gain accessibility to its targeted beneficiaries. Signed during the recent 15th landmark Manila Hotel, the memorandum of understanding calls for the extensive cooperation of ICTO and FICTAP in technology trials, assessment, evaluation, adoption and implementation of the TVWS technology connectivity in the country.</p>

											<p>FICTAP National Chair Estrellita "Neng" Juliano-Tamano who signed the MOU with ICTO Executive Director Louis Napoleon C. Casambre, subsequently called on all members of FICTAP and like-minded associates to prepare to participate in the first TVWS technology trials.

											<p>The 15th Federation of International Cable TV and Telecommunications Associations of the Philippines (FICTAP) International Congress and Exhibit will be held at the historic landmark Manila Hotel on march 6-7, 2014.</p>

											<p>Because of the benefits it brings in terms of technological updates and improved relations with concerned government agencies, suplliers and technocrats, the FICTAP Congress has become an event anticipated by the burgeoning cable industry. </p>

											<p>When it comes to providing the nation with world-class entertainment and education 24 hours a day, FICTAP has become the undisputed cable TV leader, counting members from the biggest cities to the smallest towns in the Philippine archipelago and still growing - a decade and a half sinc eits founding by a handful of countryside cable operators. </p>

											<p>FICTAP has continuously staged this annual event since its establishment in 1999. With its relentless efforts to protect and enhance the interests of its membership, FICTAP is today the authentic and recognized voice of the multi-billion cable television industry, especially of the medium and micro cable enterprises in the countryside. </p>

											<p>The yearly conventions have enabled the members of FICTAP to interact with concerned government agencies and suppliers of the latest cable technologies and merchandise. The next FICTAP convention this March will tackle the theme, "Technology Convergence: Its Impact on the Cable TV Industry."</p>
